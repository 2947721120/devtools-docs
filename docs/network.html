<h1>Evaluating network performance</h1>

<p>The Network panel records information about each network operation in your application, including detailed timing data, HTTP request and response headers, cookies, WebSocket data, and more. The Network panel helps you answer questions about the network performance of your web application, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which resource had the slowest time to first byte?</li>
<li>Which resources took the longest time to load (duration)?</li>
<li>Who initiated a particular network request?</li>
<li>How much time was spent in the various network phases for a particular resource?</li>
</ul>


<h2>About the Resource Timing API</h2>

<p>The Network panel uses the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing">Resource Timing API</a>, a JavaScript API that provides detailed network timing data for each loaded resource. For example, the API can tell you precisely when the HTTP request for an image started, and when the image's final byte was received. The following illustration shows the network timing data points that the Resource Timing API provides.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/resource-timing-overview.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<p>The API is available to any web page, not just DevTools. In Chrome, it's exposed as methods on the global <code>window.performance</code> object. The <code>performance.getEntries()</code> method returns an array of "resource timing objects", one for each requested resource on the page. </p>

<p>Try this: open the JavaScript console on the current page, enter the following at the prompt, and hit Return:</p>

<pre><code>window.performance.getEntries()[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This evaluates the first element in the array of resource timing objects and displays its properties in the console, as shown below. </p>

<p><img src="network-files/getentries.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<p>Each timestamp is in microseconds, following the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/#sec-high-resolution-time">High Resolution 
Time</a> specification. This API is <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/08/When-milliseconds-are-not-enough-performance-now">available in 
Chrome</a> as the <code>window.performance.now()</code> method.</p>

<h2>Network panel overview</h2>

<p>The Network panel automatically records all network activity while DevTools is open. The first time you open the panel it may be empty. Reload the page to start recording, or simply wait for network activity to occur in your application.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/panel.png" alt="alt text"/> </p>

<p>Each requested resource is added as a row to the Network table, which contains the columns listed below. Note the following about the Network table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all columns listed below are visible by default; you can easily <a href="#adding_and_removing_table_columns">show or hide columns</a>. </li>
<li>Some columns contain a primary field and a secondary field (<strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Latency</strong>, for example). When viewing the Network table with <a href="#changing_resource_row_size">large resource rows</a> both fields are shown; when using small resource rows only the primary field is shown.</li>
<li>You can <a href="#sorting_and_filtering">sort</a> the table by a column's value by clicking the column header. The <a href="#timeline_view">the Timeline column</a> behaves a bit differently: clicking its column header displays a menu of additional sort fields. See <a href="#timeline_view">Timeline view</a> and <a href="#sorting_and_filtering">Sorting and filtering</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preserving the network log upon navigation</h3>

<p>By default, the current network record log is discarded when you navigate to another page, or reload the current page. To preserve the recording log in these scenarios, click the black <strong>Preserve log upon navigation</strong> button <img src="network-files/keep-log-off.png" alt="alt text"/> at the bottom of the Network panel; new records are appended to the bottom of the table. Click the same button again (now red <img src="network-files/keep-log-on.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL -->) to disable log preservation.</p>

<h3>Sorting and filtering</h3>

<p>By default, resources in the Network table are sorted by the start time of each request (the network "waterfall"). You can sort the table by another column value by clicking the column header. Click the header again to change the sort order (ascending or descending). </p>

<p><img src="network-files/sorting.png" alt="alt text"/></p>

<p>The Timeline column is unique from the others in that, when clicked, it displays a menu of additional sort fields.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/timeline-column.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<p>The menu contains the following sorting options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> — Sorts by the start time of each network request. This is the default sort, and is the same as sorting by the Start Time option).</li>
<li><strong>Start Time</strong> — Sorts by the start time of each network request (same as sorting by the Timeline option).</li>
<li><strong>Response Time</strong> — Sorts by each request's response time.</li>
<li><strong>End Time</strong> — Sorts by the time when each request completed.</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong> — Sorts by the total time of each request.</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong> — Sorts by the time between the start of the request and the beginning of the response (also known as the "time to first byte").</li>
</ul>

<p>To filter the Network table to only show certain types of resources, click one of the content types along the bottom of the panel: <strong>Documents</strong>, <strong>Stylesheets</strong>, <strong>Images</strong>, <strong>Scripts</strong>, <strong>XHR</strong>, <strong>Fonts</strong>, <strong>WebSockets</strong>, and <strong>Other</strong>. In the following screenshot only CSS resources are shown. To view all content types, click the <strong>All</strong> filter button.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/filter-type.png" alt="alt text"/></p>

<h3>Adding and removing table columns</h3>

<p>You can change the default set of columns displayed by the Network table. To show or hide a column, Right+click or Control+click (Mac only) in the table header and select or deselect column names from the list.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/add-remove-columns.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<h3>Changing resource row sizes</h3>

<p>You can view the Network table with large resource rows (the default), or small resource rows. Click the blue <strong>Use small resource rows</strong> toggle button <img src="network-files/small-resource-rows.png" alt="alt text"/> at the bottom of the panel to view small rows. Click the same button (now gray <img src="network-files/large-rows.png" alt="alt text"/>) to view large resource rows again. Large rows enable some columns to display two text fields: a primary field and a secondary field (Time and Latency, for instance). When viewing small rows only the primary field is displayed. </p>

<p>In the following screenshot, the Network table is viewed with small resource rows and just the Timeline column.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/small-rows.png" alt=""></p>

<h3>Timeline view</h3>

<p>The Timeline view in the Network panel graphs the time it took to load each resource, from the start of the HTTP request to the receipt of the final byte of the response. Each resource loading time is represented as a bar, color-coded according to the resource type. The length of the lighter-shaded part of each bar represents the request's latency, while the length of the darker-shaded part represents the time spent receiving the response data.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/network-timeline.png" alt="Network timeline view"></p>

<p>When you hover your mouse over a timeline row (but not over an actual bar) the request's latency and receipt time are displayed above the corresponding bar's light- and dark-shaded areas, respectively, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/timeline-view-1.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<p>If you hover your mouse over the timeline bar itself, the complete timing data for the resource is presented in a pop-up. This is the same information that's presented in the <a href="#resource_network_timing">Timing details tab</a> for a given resource.</p>

<p><img src="network-files/timeline-view-hover.png" alt="alt text"/></p>

<p>The timeline indicates when the the <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/dom/events/DOMContentLoaded"><code>DOMContentLoaded</code></a> 
and <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/dom/events/load"><code>load</code></a> events were fired with blue and red vertical lines, respectively. The <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event is fired when the main document had been loaded and parsed. The <code>load</code> event is fired when all of the page's resources have been downloaded. </p>

<p><img src="network-files/dom-lines.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<p>Timeline bars are color-coded as follows:</p>

<p><style></p>

<p>#colortable {
  width: 50%;
  border: none;
}</p>

<p>#colortable td {
  border: none;
}</p>

<p>.doc { background: rgba(47, 102, 236, 0.6); width: 10%;}
.css { background: rgba(157, 231, 119, 0.6);width: 10%;}
.images { background: rgba(164, 60, 255, 0.6);width: 10%;}
.scripts { background: rgba(255, 121, 0, 0.6);width: 10%;}
.xhr { background: rgba(231, 231, 10, 0.6);width: 10%;}
.fonts { background: rgba(255, 82, 62,0.6);width: 10%;}
.other { background: rgba(187, 187, 188, 0.6);width: 10%;}
</style></p>

<h3>Saving and copying network information</h3>

<p>Right+clicking or Control+clicking (Mac only) within the Network table a context menu appears with several actions. Some of these actions apply to the resource row under the mouse click (like <a href="#copying_requests_as_curl_commands">copying HTTP request headers</a>), while others apply to the entire network recording (such as <a href="#saving_network_data">saving a Network recording as a HAR file</a>).</p>

<p><img src="network-files/right-click.png" alt="alt text"/> <!-- TODO: Fix alt text and URL --></p>

<p>The following menu actions apply to the selected resource:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open Link in New Tab</strong> — Opens the resource in a new tab. You can also double-click the resource name in the Network table.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Link Address</strong> — Copies the resource URL to the system clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Request Headers</strong> — Copies the HTTP request headers to the system clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Response Headers</strong> — Copies the HTTP response headers to the system clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>Copy as cURL</strong> — Copies the network request as a 
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> command string to the system clipboard. See <a href="#copying_requests_as_curl_commands">Copying requests as cURL commands</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Replay XHR</strong> — If the associated request is an XMLHTTPRequest, re-sends the original XHR.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Copying requests as cURL commands</h4>

<p><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> is a command line tool for making HTTP transactions. The Network panel's <strong>Copy as cURL</strong> command recreates an HTTP request (including HTTP headers, SSL certificates, and query string parameters) and copies it as a cURL command string to the clipboard. You can then paste the string into a terminal window (on a system with cURL) to execute the same request. </p>

<p>Below is an example cURL command line string taken from a XHR request on the Google News home page.</p>

<pre><code>curl 'http://news.google.com/news/xhrd=us' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,:sdch' -H 'Host: news.google.com' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1510.0 Safari/537.36' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Referer: http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&amp;tab=wn' -H 'Cookie: NID=67=eruHSUtoIQA-HldQn7U7G5meGuvZOcY32ixQktdgU1qSz7StUDIjC_Knit2xEcWRa-e8CuvmADminmn6h2_IRpk9rWgWMdRj4np3-DM_ssgfeshItriiKsiEXJVfra4n; PREF=ID=a38f960566524d92:U=af866b8c07132db6:FF=0:TM=1369068317:LM=1369068321:S=vVkfXySFmOcAom1K' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --compressed
</code></pre>

<h4>Saving network data</h4>

<p>You can save the data from a network recording as a HAR (<a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/">HTTP Archive</a>) file, or copy the records as a HAR data structure to your clipboard. A HAR file contains a JSON data structure that describes the network "waterfall". Several <a href="http://ericduran.github.io/chromeHAR/">third-party</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/harviewer/">tools</a> can reconstruct the network waterfall from the data in the HAR file.</p>

<p><strong>To save a recording:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Right+click or Control+click on the Network table.</li>
<li>In the context menu that appears, choose one of the following actions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Copy All as HAR</strong> — Copies the network recording to the system clipboard in the HAR format.</li>
<li><strong>Save as HAR with Content</strong> — Saves all network data to a HAR file along with each page resource. Binary resources, including images, are encoded as Base64-encoded text.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
