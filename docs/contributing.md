# Contributing to Chrome DevTools

There are many ways you can improve the productivity of your fellow developers. That could be by sharing what you know or helping out with documenting features or writing a patch to improve the tools we all use.

## How can you help?

## Keeping up-to-date

The DevTools team values feedback from developers using the tools. If you want to keep updated, you can [subscribe at crbug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/subscriptions) to the channels below. Please remember to star issues that affect you as well. Finally, don't forget to submit feature requests or bug reports for things that you find as well. Not only in the DevTools, but for all of Chrome.

## Contributing to DevTools source code

The Chrome DevTools are actually a web app written in JavaScript and CSS. If you're familiar with these technologies, you know enough to write a patch. A few folks have already done this, giving us a colorpicker, a file picker and other features, all contributed by developers just like you.
