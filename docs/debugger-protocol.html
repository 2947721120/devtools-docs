<h1>Remote debugging protocol</h1>


<p>Under the hood, Chrome Developer Tools is a web application written in HTML,
  JavaScript and CSS. It has a special binding available at JavaScript runtime
  that allows interacting with chrome pages and instrumenting them. Interaction
  protocol consists of commands that are sent to the page and events that
  the page is generating. Although Chrome Developer Tools is the primary client of
  this protocol, including for <a href="remote-debugging.html">remote debugging</a>, there are ways for third parties to use it and start
  instrumenting browser pages explicitly. We will describe the ways it could be
  done below.
</p>


<div class="collapsible">
  <h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>
  <p>Interaction protocol consists of JSON commands that are sent to the page and
    events that the page is generating. We define this protocol in Blink
    ("upstream") so that any Blink-based browser supported it.
  </p>

  <h3>Stable</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="protocol/1.1/index.html">Debugger protocol version 1.1</a> is the most recent stable release of the protocol. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As of Google Chrome 31, we commit to supporting v1.1. All subsequent 1.* versions of the protocol are going to be backwards compatible with 1.1. Our protocol backwards compatibility commitment is:
    <ul>
      <li>No commands or events are removed from the protocol.</li>
      <li>No required parameters are added to the commands.</li>
      <li>No required parameters are removed from command responses or events.</li>
    </ul>

  </p>


  <p> <b>Previous versions</b>:
    <a href="protocol/1.0/index.html">Protocol v1.0</a> was shipped and supported as of Chrome 18.
    <a href="protocol/0.1/index.html">Protocol v0.1</a> was shipped and supported as of Chrome 16.
  </p>


  <h3>Alpha</h3>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/devtools/protocol.json&q=protocol.json&sq=package:chromium&type=cs">tip-of-tree protocol</a> is volatile and may break at any time. However it captures the full capabilities of the Protocol, whereas the stable release is a subset. There is no backwards compatibility support guaranteed for the capabilities it introduces. You can
    use it with <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs">Google Canary</a>
    builds at your own risk.  

    A <i>portion</i> of the tip-of-tree protocol is documented in the <a href="protocol/tot/index.html">tot section here</a>; it may be slightly more complete than what's in <a href="protocol/1.1/index.html">1.1</a>.
  </p>

  <p>You can inspect how the Chrome DevTools uses the protocol. Especially handy when looking up newer features. First, <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/contributing#step_3_inspector_inception">inspect the inspector</a> and reload the inspector so your attached one can view its WebSocket connection (<code>Network > Filter > WebSockets</code>). Then view the frames of WebSocket activity as you use the host DevTools. You may need to re-click the WebSocket item to have the Frame activity update.</p>

<div class="collapsible">
  <h2 id="remote">Debugging over the wire</h2>
  <p>Today Developer Tools front-end can attach to a remotely running Chrome
    instance for debugging.

    For this scenario to work, you should start your
    <i>host</i> Chrome instance with the remote-debugging-port
    command line switch:
  </p>

  <pre class="summary">
    chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222
  </pre>

  <p>Then you can start a <i>client</i> Chrome instance, using a separate user profile:</p>

  <pre class="summary">
    chrome.exe --user-data-dir=&lt;some directory&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>And now you can navigate to the given port from your <i>client</i> and attach to
    any of the discovered tabs for debugging: <a href="http://localhost:9222">http://localhost:9222</a>
  </p>

  <p>You will find Developer Tools interface identical to the embedded one and
    here is why:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you navigate your <i>client</i> browser to the remote's Chrome port,
      Developer Tools front-end is being served from the <i>host</i> Chrome
      as a Web Application from the Web Server.
    </li>
    <li>It fetches HTML, JavaScript and CSS files over HTTP
    </li>
    <li>Once loaded, Developer Tools establishes a Web Socket connection to its
      host and starts interchanging JSON messages with it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this scenario, you can substitute Developer Tools front-end with your
    own implementation. Instead of navigating to the HTML page at
    http://localhost:9222, your application can discover available
    pages by requesting:
  </p>

  <a href="http://localhost:9222/json">http://localhost:9222/json</a>


  <p>and getting a JSON object with information about inspectable pages along
    with the WebSocket addresses that you could use in order to start
    instrumenting them.
  </p>

  <p>Remote debugging is especially useful when debugging remote
    instances of the browser or attaching to the embedded devices. Blink port
    owners are responsible for exposing debugging connections to the external
    users.
  </p>

<div class="collapsible">
  <h2 id="clients">Debugging Protocol Clients</h2>
  <p>Many applications and libraries already use the protocol. Some to collect 
    performance data, others to breakpoint debug from another editor. There are 
    libraries to access the raw protocol from Node.js and Python.
  </p>

  <p>Many of these clients are showcased here: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugging-clients">Showcased Debugging Protocol Clients</a>.
  </p>

</div>



<div class="collapsible">
  <h2 id="extension">Using debugger extension API</h2>
  <p>
    To allow third parties to interact with the protocol, we introduced
    <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/debugger.html">chrome.debugger</a> 
    extension API that exposes this JSON message
    transport interface. As a result, you can not only attach to the remotely
    running Chrome instance, but also instrument it from its own extension.
  </p>

  <p>Chrome Debugger Extension API provides a higher level API where command
    domain, name and body are provided explicitly in the <code>sendCommand</code>
    call. This API hides request ids and handles binding of the request with its
    response, hence allowing <code>sendCommand</code> to report result in the
    callback function call. One can also use this API in combination with the other
    Extension APIs.
  </p>

  <p>If you are developing a Web-based IDE, you should implement an extension that
    exposes debugging capabilities to your page and your IDE will be able to open
    pages with the target application, set breakpoints there, evaluate expressions
    in console, live edit JavaScript and CSS, display live DOM, network interaction
    and any other aspect that Developer Tools is instrumenting today.
  </p>

  <p>Opening embedded Developer Tools will <a href="#simultaneous">terminate</a> the
    remote connection and thus detach the extension.
  </p>



</div>



<div class="collapsible">
  <h2 id="simultaneous">Simultaneous protocol clients</h2>
  <p>
    We currently do not support multiple clients connected to the protocol simultaneously. That includes the DevTools opening while another client is connected. On the bug tracker, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=129539">crbug.com/129539</a> follows the issue; you can star it for email updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon disconnnection, the outgoing client will receive a <code>detached</code> event. For example: <code>{"method":"Inspector.detached","params":{"reason":"replaced_with_devtools"}}</code>. View the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/out/Debug/gen/chrome/common/extensions/api/debugger.cc&q=file:debugger.cc%20Reason%20ParseReason&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&">enum of possible reasons.</a>  (For reference: the <a href="https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/11361034/">original patch</a>). After disconnection, some apps have chosen to pause their state and offer a reconnect button.
