1. In the root of the project, start a [server] (https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/3fa2e7dc1f1ea5eaf7f6a2531b937ff8bd8833f9/.functions#L25-L32).

1. open [http://localhost:8000/docs/_preview.html](http://localhost:8000/docs/_preview.html)
1. you'll see the boilerplate along with a directory listing
